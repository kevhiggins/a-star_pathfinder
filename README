This pathfinder uses the A* search algorithm
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm

To see the pathfinder in action check out bin/PFDemo.swf

To use the khiggins.pathfinder package, implement the INode interface.
An example of this can be seen in khiggins/demo/Tile.as

In order to compile using make, you need the Adobe Flex SDK
http://www.ghostwire.com/aspireui/docs/basics/compiling-with-flex-mxmlc

Throw mxmlc in your path and you can make with the Makefile
